          <p>Hello Everyone! I warmly welcome you to my reading room.</p>
          
  <p>I started my writing journey relatively late. When COVID hit the world and everything paused, I started going deep into my inner world. I began questioning society, driven by an absurd, burning desire to create a utopian world. I always wanted everything to be perfect; I thought when I grew up, I would change everything for the better. And while life may have thrown a lot of stones at me since then—as it does to everyone—the light of that belief still burns deep within. I truly believe that we humans can achieve true peace and happiness in this lifetime.</p>

  <p>I started watching spiritual videos during my 12th board preparations. It was there that I first realized humans have the potential to do absolutely anything. So, I thought, why not do the absolute best for my country and humankind? I am not boasting; these were my genuine thoughts. I wanted to change the world.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #FFD700; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 400;">The Reality of Power</h3>
  <p>Reality hit when I entered college. Practical life was different. Money was an issue. Power was an issue. I observed that those in power often do not want to do anything good, and they actively prevent good people from rising to the top. But the worst realization of all was observing the path itself: the road that leads to political power is inherently corrupt.</p>

<p>If you walk that path, you have to compromise. If you disagree, let me break it down for you. When you ask for votes, you do not ask based on what is objectively best for society; you ask for votes based on the immediate needs and desires of the individual. One individual, ten, a thousand—they all have conflicting opinions. What do you do when their desires don't align with what is right? You start to lie. And lying is the first step toward unintended corruption. Secondly, once you gain power, to remain there, you must fulfill those lies—even when you know it will harm society in the long run.</p>

<p>In short, power is a psychological trap, a theme we explore deeply in the Essays section.</p>

<h3 style="color: #FFD700; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 400;">The Shift to the Pen</h3>
<p>It was in that moment of realization that I understood how incredibly hard it is to change the world from the top down. One can only truly change oneself. So, here I am. Writing. Doing what I love. I write stories, poems, and, of course, social commentaries.</p>

<p>You can access my website based on three distinct moods:</p>

<ul style="list-style: none; padding-left: 0; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    <strong style="color: #81C784; font-size: 1.2rem; letter-spacing: 0.1em; text-transform: uppercase;">Essays</strong><br>
    The serious room. Go here to read social commentary, learn something new, and think. Pause here, and change the world.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    <strong style="color: #E57373; font-size: 1.2rem; letter-spacing: 0.1em; text-transform: uppercase;">Poems</strong><br>
    Soft, and sometimes brutal. Just things I like to write. Relax here, and if my words make you cry, I will take that as a win.
  </li>
  <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
    <strong style="color: #64B5F6; font-size: 1.2rem; letter-spacing: 0.1em; text-transform: uppercase;">Fiction</strong><br>
    This may be the least active room, but it will be the most creative. Be ready to be thrilled.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="color: #FFD700; margin-top: 3rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem; font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: 400;">The Purpose</h3>
<p>As for my milestones, I was shortlisted for the PM YUVA 3.0 program, where I wrote a book proposal on philosophy under the Indian Knowledge Systems (though I did not make the final cut). Yes, I write philosophy too—you will discover that quickly in the Essays section.</p>

<p>My ultimate purpose is education. I believe education is the master key to changing the world. If the right education can spark a light in me to move in a positive direction—a light so strong that nothing can make me walk a grey path, not even hunger or death threats (unless my family is in question)—then good education can spark that same light in a thousand other people. And a thousand people are enough to change an entire system.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 3rem; font-size: 1.4rem; font-style: italic; color: #fff; text-align: center;">
  So this is Pranshu Gupta, welcoming you all to a journey of self-discovery and growth.<br>
  Looking forward to connecting with you all. <br><br>
  <span style="color: #FFD700;">Spread love, as love makes us free. And remember, the ultimate goal is to be free.</span>
